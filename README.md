# PhenoMapper

PhenoMapper is an extension of Mapper Interactive, which is a web-based framework for interactive analysis and visualization of high-dimensional point cloud data built upon the mapper algorithm.

The Mapper algorithm is a tool from topological data analysis first introduced by Gurjeet Singh, Facundo MÃ©moli and Gunnar Carlsson in 2007 (http://dx.doi.org/10.2312/SPBG/SPBG07/091-100). 


## Installation

```bash
git clone git@github.com:tdavislab/PhenoMapper.git
cd PhenoMapper
python3 run.py
```

After running the above commands, you can run Mapper Interactive by visiting http://127.0.0.1:8000/ on the local machine (If possible, please use Chrome).

## Dependencies
This software requires [Kepler Mapper](https://kepler-mapper.scikit-tda.org/), [scikit-learn](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/), [NetworkX](https://networkx.github.io/) and [flask](https://flask.palletsprojects.com/en/1.1.x/) to run.

If you do not have these packages installed, please use the following command to intall them.

```bash
pip install scikit-learn
